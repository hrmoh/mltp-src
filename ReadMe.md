This is my first VC++ program which I had developed during two weeks (I guess it might be May 2000). I did not know how to program in VC++ back then, so in a stressful period (I needed it to get 5 scores from 20 scores needed to pass my Theory of Machines and Languages course at my 2nd year in university) using Sams Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 21 Days I managed to build this application which I guess some parts of it might not have sensible code behind it! At last there was no CD-ROM available at university the day we ought to present our applications and because the professor needed to announce score he randomly gave me a 3 or so score! So my stressful attempts did not result in what I was hoping for!
So it is mostly something personal for me and not a real application!
It is an ancient piece of code (Visual C++ 6.0 MFC), So in order to get it compiled against Visual Studio 2019 I have set "Force Conformance in For Loop Scope" to "No". You would receive lots of assertions errors if you try to run it in debug mode in VS 2019 so if you are interested in compiling and running it, I would suggest try the Release mode. I have included a compiled binary (using VC++ 6.0) in releases.
